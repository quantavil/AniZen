## 💎 Exclusive Pro Features

### 🧠 Anime4K Neural Upscaling
Experience your library in true 4K. Integrated **Anime4K neural networks** allow real-time upscaling of 720p/1080p content to 4K with stunning clarity.
*   👉 **[Read the Anime4K Guide](docs/ANIME4K_GUIDE.md)** for Mode & Performance details.

### ⚙️ The "Zero-Lag" Engine
We’ve rewritten the internal MPV configuration to eliminate mobile-specific bottlenecks:
*   **Audio-First Sync:** Default sync logic swapped to eliminate the "leg" (stutter) found in official builds.
*   **Intelligent HWDEC:** Automatic `mediacodec-copy` switching only when required by filters, preserving battery and performance.
*   **Low-Overhead Monitoring:** Technical stats (FPS/Mistime) now use an efficient polling system instead of background-draining push events.
*   **High Quality Scaling:** Edge-shaping via `ewa_lanczossharp` for the sharpest anime lines.
*   👉 **[Read the Pro Player Guide](docs/PRO_PLAYER_GUIDE.md)** for technical deep dives.

### 📥 1DM+ Style Downloader
Engineered for speed. We've increased the concurrent episode limit to **30** and implemented multi-threaded chunking to saturate your bandwidth.

### 🖐️ Premium Tactile Experience
AniZen feels "alive." We’ve integrated subtle, professional-grade haptic feedback into:
*   Volume and Brightness sliders.
*   Seek bar scrubbing.
*   Settings toggles and Switches.
*   Library and Search item interactions.
*   Navigation and Header branding.

### 🎨 Ultimate Filter Suite
A granular, card-based UI allows you to adjust **Sharpen, Blur, Grain, and Debanding** on the fly, with high-performance presets like *Vivid Anime* and *Cinema*.
